    "\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "    <li><b>Establishing a Takaful Company:</b> The Takaful process begins with the establishment of a Takaful company, which is responsible for managing the Takaful fund and facilitating the entire process. This includes obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals, licenses, and setting up the infrastructure for operations.</li>\n",
    "    <li><b>Participants and Contributions:</b> Participants, also known as policyholders, are individuals or entities seeking insurance coverage. They choose a Takaful plan based on their needs, whether it's Basic Takaful, Medical & Health Takaful, or Family and Investment-Linked Takaful. Participants make regular contributions, which are referred to as premiums, to the Takaful operator.</li>\n",
    "    <li><b>Creation of the Takaful Fund:</b> The premiums collected from participants are pooled together to create the Takaful fund. This fund is separate from the Takaful operator's other financial assets and is dedicated solely to fulfilling Takaful obligations. It's crucial to maintain transparency and separation to ensure Sharia compliance.</li>\n",
    "    <li><b>Risk Assessment and Underwriting:</b> Before providing coverage, the Takaful operator assesses the risks associated with each participant. This process is known as underwriting. Factors such as age, health status, and the type of coverage required are considered to determine the participant's eligibility and the applicable premium.</li>\n",
    "    <li><b>Surplus Sharing and Fund Management:</b> The Takaful operator manages the Takaful fund, which includes investing its assets in Sharia-compliant investments. Any surplus generated from the Takaful fund, after covering claims, operational expenses, and reserves, is distributed among the participants according to predefined rules. This surplus sharing reinforces the cooperative and ethical nature of Takaful.</li>\n",
    "    <li><b>Claims Settlement:</b> When a participant experiences a covered loss or event, they file a claim with the Takaful operator. The operator assesses the claim and, if valid, disburses funds from the Takaful fund to compensate the participant or beneficiary. The goal is to provide financial support during times of need.</li>\n",
    "    <li><b>Sharia Compliance:</b> Throughout the entire process, strict adherence to Sharia principles is maintained. Investments made using the Takaful fund must comply with Islamic ethics, ensuring they are free from interest, speculative activities, and non-compliant industries.</li>\n",
    "    <li><b>Governance and Supervision:</b> Takaful operations are subject to regulatory oversight by relevant authorities to ensure compliance with legal and ethical standards. Takaful operators are also guided by Sharia boards or scholars who provide guidance on Islamic financial principles.</li>\n",
    "    <li><b>Continuous Education and Support:</b> Takaful agents play a vital role in educating potential participants about Takaful products and helping them choose the right coverage. Agents also provide ongoing support, including assisting with claims and addressing any questions or concerns.</li>\n",
    "    <li><b>Reporting and Transparency:</b> Transparency is a key aspect of Takaful operations. Regular reports and financial statements are provided to participants, allowing them to track the performance of the Takaful fund and understand how their contributions are managed.</li>\n",
